          Established in 1981 by Cultural Medallion recipient Mr Alex Abisheganaden, NUS Guitar Ensemble (GENUS) is
          Singapore’s leading guitar ensemble. Initially comprising only classical prime guitars, GENUS was later
          modelled after the Niibori Orchestra in Japan, becoming the pioneering Niibori guitar ensemble in Singapore.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike solo classical, acoustic or electric guitar playing, the Niibori method utilises a family of guitars
          with varying pitches, creating endless exciting musical possibilities for the instrument. Through innovative
          performance elements such as the Niibori Rhythm Method, GENUS seeks to present immersive and impactful
          performances, bringing a greater appreciation and recognition of our art form to our audience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under the directorship of Dr Robert Casteels, GENUS is proud to have performed an ever-changing, colourful
          repertoire, ranging from major classical works to contemporary Japanese pieces. As a pioneer in the local
          scene, GENUS aims to uphold strong musical standards, setting the benchmark of musical excellence for local
          ensembles while establishing connections with international ensembles. GENUS is continually working towards
          promoting a greater love for guitar ensemble music in Singapore, so as to establish the guitar art form as an
          integral part of the local arts landscape.
        </p>
        <p>
          In pursuit of musical excellence and continued improvement, GENUS offers our members an environment that is
          both nurturing and challenging. Beginning with a structured workshop programme for newcomers, each member’s
          journey promises ample performance and learning opportunities — through annual concerts, external performances
          and overseas exchanges. Notably, GENUS has embarked on tours to Japan and Germany, attained awards in local
          and international competitions, and performed for events from Esplanade’s In Youthful Company performance
          series to the ASEAN University Games.

            Our Founder: Mr Alex Abisheganaden
          </div>

          <p>
            Mr. Alex Abisheganaden is the founder and Honorary Conductor of GENUS. In 1986, he introduced the concept of
            Niibori guitars to the Ensemble. Since then, Niibori guitars have gained immense popularity in the
            Singaporean music scene.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having excelled as a guitarist, singer, double bassist, conductor and actor in dramas, musicals and operas,
            Mr. Abisheganaden is one of Singapore's best-known musicians and stage personalities. In addition, he has
            shown other facets of his talent as a writer, composer and music adjudicator. Some of his famous works
            include "Huan Ying-Vanakam" and "Gela-Nexus" (Amalgamation of GENUS and his name), both of which were
            performed by GENUS in Singapore and Germany in 2007. Mr. Abisheganaden also founded the Singapore Classical
            Guitar Society in 1967 and remained at its helm for 25 years.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1988, in recognition of his leadership and involvement in music in Singapore as a performer, teacher,
            adjudicator and impresario, he was awarded our government’s prestigious Singapore Cultural Medallion award.
            Apart from this award, Mr. Abisheganaden also received the COMPASS Meritorious Award from the Composers &
            Authors Society of Singapore.

            Music Director & Resident Conductor: Dr Robert Casteels
          </div>

          <p>
            Composer, conductor, pianist, educator and arts administrator, Dr Robert Casteels believes that these
            activities form an intertwined and kaleidoscopic part of music making.
          </p>
          <p>
            Casteels has conducted professional orchestras in 20 countries with a repertoire of 600 works ranging from
            the early classics to contemporary music. He has conducted first performances of symphonic works and operas
            in major festivals in Europe, the USA and Australia. After graduating from the Guildhall School of Music of
            London and the Juilliard School in New York, Casteels was appointed staff conductor at the Brussels Royal
            Opera House and Head of conducting studies at the Brussels (Flemish) Royal Music Conservatory. In 2001 he
            was awarded the Christoffel Plantin prize, Flanders’ highest cultural award, for his cross-cultural
            research.
          </p>
          <p>
            Casteels took up permanent residency in Singapore in 1996 and citizenship in 2007. He has contributed
            tirelessly to Singapore’s music scene, as a member of various arts related committees, as Dean of the
            Faculty of Performing Arts at LASALLE-SIA College of the Arts, as Music Director of the Singapore National
            Youth Orchestra and as Artistic Director of ‘I’mPULSE’, Asia-Europe Foundation’s first music camp held in
            The Philippines. Casteels has premiered significant masterpieces in Singapore, such as works by Boulez,
            Ligeti, Takemitsu, Stockhausen and Varèse. In April 2004, Casteels was appointed the first
            Associate-in-Residence (Special Music Projects) by the Centre For the Arts, National University of Singapore
            (NUS).
          </p>
          <p>
            A composer in his own right, Casteels has written a growing corpus of 120 musical works that cross several
            cultures, genres and disciplines.

        <h1><strong>About |</strong></h1>
        <h2 class="pl-4" style="align-self: center"> The Niibori Method </h2>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <h4>Alto</h4>
        <p>
          First, the Alto guitars. Being tuned a perfect fifth higher than a normal classical guitar, an Alto
          guitar can also be said to be the king of high pitch guitars. The distances between the frets are
          smaller in an Alto guitar than a normal classical guitar, allowing people with small hands to play
          the Alto guitar with ease. In addition, this makes the Alto guitar suitable to play the melody and
          counter-melody as it can be optimally used to play fast runs that are usually played by instruments
          like the violin.

          The alto guitar is the smallest and highest-sounding guitar in a standard Niibori guitar ensemble.
          It is tuned a 5th higher than the standard classical guitar. Alto players are usually entrusted with
          the melody in the pieces we play, and can frequently be seen playing high up on the necks of their
          guitars! Fast runs and tremolos are also common sounds in these sections.
        </p>

        <h4>Prime</h4>
        <p>
          The second member of the Niibori family would be the Prime guitars. This is also recognized as the standard
          classical guitar which is commonly used during solo guitar playing. In the Niibori Orchestra, it is called the
          Prime guitar to differentiate it from the other guitars. All Niibori guitars are tuned relative to the Prime
          guitar. The Prime guitar is indispensable to the Niibori guitar orchestra as it is mainly responsible for
          chords, which adds depth to the pieces. However, it is not only limited to chords as it can also take on the
          melody as well, making it one of the more versatile guitar in the orchestra.

          Prime guitars are the standard classical guitars most of us are familiar with. The role of the prime section
          evolves with each piece we play - oftentimes chords and arpeggios, but also melodies, tremolos and bass notes.
          With the wide range of techniques, there’s never a dull moment as a prime player!

        </p>


        <h4>Bass</h4>
        <p>
          The third member would be the Bass guitars. The Bass guitar is tuned a fourth lower than a Prime guitar,
          giving it the same tuning as an Alto guitar, but one octave lower. Contrary to popular belief that the Bass
          guitar only takes on the bass line, it can sometimes take on the melody as well. Its characteristic tone makes
          it important in the Niibori guitar orchestra. In fact, it can be used to play solo parts of certain pieces as
          well.

          In addition to the Bass guitar, there is also the upright Guitarron, an instruments with South American roots.
          It is shaped differently from the other Niibori guitars, giving it a warm and rich tone. It's very deep bass
          sound is very important in helping to gel the different parts of a Niibori guitar orchestral piece together.
          Also unique to the Guitarron, it is the only instrument in the Niibori guitar orchestra that is fretless.
          Playing a Guitarron requires different left and right hand techniques as compared to the other types of
          Niibori guitars.

          Also in the Bass family are the Contrabass guitars, which are tuned one octave lower than Prime guitars. Since
          the very deep bass sound of the Guitarron is not easily picked up by listeners, the Contrabass guitars are
          important in helping to bridge the Bass and the Guitarron parts together, and add on to the depth of the music
          produced.

          The bass family comprises the bass guitar, the contrabass guitar and the guitarron, and plays an important
          role in keeping the rhythm of the ensemble.
          The bass and contrabass guitars are usually played with the thumb instead of the fingers. Don’t be fooled into
          thinking Bass parts are easy or boring to play! The warm tone of the bass guitar lends itself well to playing
          beautiful melodies too.
          The guitarron is a large, fretless guitar with a rounded body, played upright by plucking the strings
          outwards. Despite having Latin American roots and resembling guitarrons used in Mexican mariachi groups, our
          version of a guitarron is truly unique to Niibori guitar ensembles!

        </p>

        <h4>Other Special Instruments</h4>
        <p>
          Other than the main members of the Niibori family, other special Niibori guitar instruments are sometimes
          featured in certain pieces. One such Niibori guitar is the Soprano guitar, which is tuned one octave higher
          than the Prime guitar. Another family of Niibori guitar is the Cembalo guitars or 12-stringed guitars. This
          includes the Alto Cembalo and Prime Cembalo which are 12 string counterparts to the Alto and Prime guitars
          respectively. Unlike the normal Niibori guitars, the Cembalos are often played with needles at the finger tips
          instead of plucking the strings directly with the fingers. These unique members add a different colour to the
          music produced and often can be found taking the limelight in orchestral pieces.
